<!-- ## Dependencies (no longer used, going with browser based encryption instead)
- [A Rust implementation of Olm and Megolm]https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac with bindings from [polyjuice_newt](https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_newt)
- [ed25519](https://hex.pm/packages/ed25519)
- [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) in the user's browser with bindings copied from [livesecret](https://github.com/JesseStimpson/livesecret) -->

## How to use it

<!-- The `olm` dependency requires [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) (a native C library, which is available in several distributions).

On Debian one can install it like so:

`apt install libolm-dev`

On Alpine:

`pkg install olm`

On Mac:

`brew install libolm` -->
